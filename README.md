# HR-OOV

SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application but often proves challenging due to linguistic ambiguity, synonymy, polysemy, and so forth. This problem is exacerbated when queries are entirely out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with respect to the target ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on a language model-based ontology embedding method named OnT. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of single and multiple concepts. We find that our method outperforms the baselines, including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools and evaluation datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HR-OOV-8F4A.
